# Writing Guidelines for Space Weather Reports

User preferences and style guidelines learned from refinement sessions.

## Headlines

**Preferences:**
- *To be learned from usage*

**Examples:**
- Good: "M5.3 flare signals uptick in solar activity"
- Poor: "Solar activity moderate"

## Flare Descriptions

**Required Elements:**
- Flare class (M5.3, X1.2, etc.)
- UTC time (specific: "06:24 UTC" not "morning")
- Active region (AR####)
- Location coordinates when available

**Example:**
"An M5.3 flare peaked at 06:24 UTC from AR4274 (N24E45), causing an R2 (moderate) radio blackout."

## CME Descriptions

**Required Elements:**
- CME start time
- Analysis type (Leading Edge, Shock Front, or both)
- Speed (km/s)
- Earth-directed status
- Arrival prediction with uncertainty
- Kp forecast with G-scale equivalent

**Example:**
"A CME erupted at 10:53 UTC with Leading Edge analysis showing speeds of 1123 km/s. ENLIL model runs predict Earth arrival on November 7 at 03:18 UTC (±7 hours), with Kp indices forecast to reach 7-9, indicating G3-G4 (strong/severe) geomagnetic storm conditions."

## Forecast Structure

**3-Day Format:**
```
November 7: [Specific activity expected]
November 8: [Specific activity expected]
November 9: [Specific activity expected]
```

**Include:**
- Expected flare activity level
- CME arrivals if predicted
- Geomagnetic storm conditions
- Solar wind conditions if notable

## Technical Terms

**Always explain on first use:**
- Kp index → include G-scale equivalent
- R-scale → include impact description
- Beta-gamma-delta → note high flare probability
- Halo CME → explain Earth-directed significance

## Tone

*To be refined based on user feedback*

- Professional but accessible
- Engaging without sensationalizing
- Clear about uncertainties
- Specific with data and timing

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

*This section will be populated from refinement sessions*

1. Vague timing ("this morning" vs "06:24 UTC")
2. Missing Kp forecasts for CMEs
3. Incomplete active region descriptions
4. Generic headlines
5. Unclear forecast structure
